Installation notes (for creating a new release and installing at Diamond)
Updated to give correct order.
=========================================================================

1) Create new install folder (Savu/install/$version_install)
    a) Create folder
    b) Copy all files and folders from previous installation into it
    c) Clone the previous version_future environment and add to it (if future install exists)
        OR if creating new fully updated release (e.g. future version), clone without version numbers
        - conda env export -n root > environment.yml
        - Remove libraries (mpi4py, hdf5, h5py, astra, xraylib, savu, pycuda, tomopy)
    d) Update conda recipes (including version number in savu recipe)

2) a) Update Savu/install/latest_version.py to contain the new version number (and the corresponding file)
   b) Update Savu/install/all_versions.txt file to include this release (do this at the very last minute).
   c) copy the latest module version and update according to the instructions.
    -e.g. create 2.0_stable, 2.0_branch, 2.0_future  (see below)
   d) Update installation notes with the latest tested versions of libraries and new link

3) Create tar.gz of the new install folder
   >>> tar -zcvf savu_v2.3.tar.gz savu_v2.3/
   >>> update docs and re-build

4) Push all changes to Github (ensure all tests passing)

5) Test conda installation against Savu master version
   a) Download and unzip folder from Savu installation guide
   b) >>> bash /path_to_download/Savu_v2.0/savu_installer.sh -f dls -c 2.3_stable -s master
	# Add e.g. -i 2_4_install if you want to use these conda recipes without updating the latest version file (and not pushing to github)

Check SAVU_PLUGINS_PATH is working by 'module load savu/2.3' and checking configurator list

6) a) Install any new libraries
   b) Re-clone environment ( conda env export -n root > environment.yml) and update savu_installer.sh if necessary  - remove libraries again (detailed above).
   c) Add all changes to Github
   e) Update zip folder
   d) Re-run installation again

7) Run full-field and multi-modal mapping tests (from cluster testdir)

8) Create release

9) remove master install and conda install new version of Savu
    >>> module load savu/2.3_stable
    >>> conda uninstall savu
    Download new conda zip file.
    >>> export FACILITY=dls
    >>> conda build savu_v2.3/savu
    >>> savu_build=`conda build savu_v2.3/savu --output`
    >>> conda install $savu_build

Check module file again after release (current testing install in scratch location).

========================EXTRA THINGS======================================
- add SAVU_PLUGINS_PATH=/dls_sw/apps/savu/savu_plugins_v2.3
    (or something similar) to module load file.
- need to unzip the ccpi python egg so it doesn't extract at run time.
- Fix tomopy
- Add new release to all_versions file (prior to release)!!!
