Savu
----

Savu pythons are known for their small size, good temperament, easy feeding habits and tolerance for a wide range of temperatures.[1]
The Savu Tomography reconstruction pipeline project aims to mimic these behaviours being a small package, which is easy to use and reliable, chomps its way through vast amounts of data, and finally is portable to a wide range of systems.
