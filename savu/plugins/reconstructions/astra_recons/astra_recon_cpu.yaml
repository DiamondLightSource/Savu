                        line: The weight of a ray/pixel pair is given by the
                          length of the intersection of the pixel and the ray,
                          considered as a zero-thickness line.
                        strip: The weight of a ray/pixel pair is given by the
                          area of the intersection of the pixel and the ray,
                          considered as a strip with the same width as a
                          detector pixel.
                        linear: Linear interpolation between the two nearest
                          volume pixels of the intersection of the ray and
                          the column/row.
