How to cite Savu software
=========================

.. start_of_main_text

The relevant citations for your Savu job are contained in the "citations.txt" file in the Savu output folder, in BibTeX and EndNote formats.  These include:

* Savu framework citations
* Plugin citations - specific to your process list

All citations are also contained in both the Savu process list and output Savu nexus file and can be extracted into BibTeX and EndNote formats using the savu_citations tool.  From the command line run:

>>> savu_citations <your_nxs_file> <out_file_name>

Where the output file is the name of the file you would like to extract this information to.

For example,

>>> savu_citations  process_lists.nxs  citations.txt

*** Please include all Savu citations in your relevant publications ***
