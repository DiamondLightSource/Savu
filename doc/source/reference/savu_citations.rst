How to cite Savu software
=========================

.. start_of_main_text

All citations are contained in both the Savu process list and output Savu nexus file.  These include:

* Savu framework citations
* Plugin citations - specific to your process list

You can extract these citations into BibTeX and EndNote formats using the savu_citations tool.  From the command line run:

>>> savu_citations <your_nxs_file> <out_file_name>

Where the output file is the name of the file you would like to extract this information to.

For example,

>>> savu_citations  process_lists.nxs  citations.txt

*** Please include all Savu citations in your relevant publications ***
