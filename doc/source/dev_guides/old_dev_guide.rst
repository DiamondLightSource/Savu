Savu Developer Information
**************************

Release Strategy
================

When a new release is required the following process should be done.  
Make a new branch for convinience if fixes are needed, it should be called vX.Y-release i.e v0.1-release.
After the branch is made, move to it and then create a release tag for it called vX.Y.Z i.e v0.1.0, where Z starts at 0, and future minor release verisons can be made with v0.1.1 etc later on down the branch.

Once this is done, Zenodo.org will automatically create and archive an artefact.

We should then update the pypi stuff.


Developing on a feature branch
==============================

Make a new Branch for development and move to it
	git checkout -b new_branch

Make modifications and commit as normal
	git commit -m "test commit"
	
push this branch up to github
	git push --set-upstream origin new_branch
	
get all the latest data from github on all branches
	git fetch

to keep up to date, merge recent changes from master into the development branch and fix issues if there are any
	git merge origin/master
	
Continue working with the branch untill you are happy with the new feature, merge master into it as shown before and fix up issues, then merge the branch into master
	
move to master
	git checkout master

update
	git pull

merge in the new branch
	git merge new_branch

there should be no problems if you have merge master in first, so just push back up
	git push


..
    Developing new Plugins
    ======================

    The architecture of the savu package is that new plugins can be easily developed
    without having to take the framework into consideration.  This is mostly true for
    simple cases, however there are some thigns which cannot be done with such 
    simple methodologies and the developer may need to take more into consideration.

    Every plugin in Savu needs to be a subclass of the Plugin class, however there 
    are several convenience subclasses which already exist for doing standard 
    processes such as filtering, reconstruction and augmentation/passthrough

    Although there are many plugins defined in the core savu code, plugins can be 
    written anywhere and included easily as shown below without having to be submitted
    to the core code.

    Median Filter Example
    ---------------------

    This examples recreates one of the core plugins, a median filter.  The code is 
    available in the main Savu repository under the plugin_examples folder.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../plugin_examples/example_median_filter.py
       :linenos:

    As you can see this is a pretty small implementation, and the key features of
    which are detailed in the comments associated with the code.

.. 
    Testing the new plugin
    ======================

    So now that you have the new plugin written, you can test it using the following
    command, you will need to make sure that savu is installed or included in your
    $PYTHON_PATH

    .. code:: bash

       python $SAVU_HOME/savu/test/framework_test.py -p $SAVU_HOME/plugin_examples/example_median_filter /tmp/savu_output/


Testing a new plugin using DAWN
===============================

DAWN can be downloaded from http://www.dawnsci.org/ and general user tutorials 
are found at https://www.youtube.com/user/DAWNScience

Using the Debug perspective, create a new test, e.g. "tomopy_recon_test.py"
to test your plugin in "/Savu/savu/test/", in this case the 
"example_filter_back_projection.py" plugin for reconstructing data, setting the
self.plugin_name appropriately.  After saving the file, right-click on it in 
the PyDev Package Explorer window and Run As a Python unit-test

.. literalinclude:: ../../../savu/test/travis/plugin_tests/reconstruction_tests/tomopy_recon_test.py
   :linenos:

This runs a series of tests and produces an output file with the result of the
plugin, whether it be a filter or a reconstruction, allowing for visualisation
of the data, providing a check of whether the process has worked successfully.

The output file is saved in a tmp directory as a .h5 file, e.g.
"/tmp/tmp32bexK.h5".  This can be viewed in DAWN.


Adding C/C++ extensions to a plugin
===================================

There are numerous ways to create python bindings to external C/C++ libraries, which may be useful to recycle existing code or to improve performance.  Two different approaches have currently been tested: Cython (to link to external C code) and Boost.Python (to link to external C++ code).  Cython is essentially python with C-types and requires a C-API, a python wrapper and a makefile, whilst Boost.Python is a wrapper for the Python/C API and requires a wrapper and a makefile. By building the makefile a shared library (\*.so) file is created and can be added to the \\lib directory in the Savu framework and imported as a python module.  

Cython Example
--------------
http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/clibraries.html

1) A C interface: A \*.pxd file, which is similar to a C header file, providing C function definitions required in the python code. For example, cdexing.pxd:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../extension_examples/cdezing.pyd
   :linenos:

2) A python wrapper: A \*.pyx file that must have a different name to the \*.pyd file above. For example, dezing.pyx:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../extension_examples/dezing.pyx
   :linenos:

3) Makefile: In python this is a setup.py file.  For example, setup.py:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../extension_examples/setup.py
   :linenos:

Compile this file, passing appropriate C compiler flags if necessary, to obtain a \*.so file.

e.g.
export CFLAGS="-I . $CFLAGS" \
export LDFLAGS="-L . $LDFLAGS" \
python setup.py build_ext -i

The output file for this example is a dezing.so file.  Transfer this file to \lib and import as a python module, e.g. import dezing

Boost.Python Example
--------------------
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/

Boost.python aims to expose C++ classes/functions to python, without changing the original code. 

1) A python wrapper: Create the python module and define the external function names.  For example, example_wrapper.cpp

.. literalinclude:: ../../../extension_examples/example_wrapper.cpp
   :linenos:

2) A makefile: A standard C++ makefile, incorporating Boost.Python path, to build a shared object library (\*.so).  For example, example_makefile

.. literalinclude:: ../../../extension_examples/example_makefile
   :linenos:

The output file for this example is a example.so file.  Transfer this file to \lib and import as a python module, e.g. import example, then simply access a function from within your python code as example.example_function1(...).

The class and header files example.cpp and example.hpp (below) along with example_wrapper.cpp, illustrate how to incorporate numpy arrays into the extension. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../extension_examples/example.hpp
   :linenos:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../extension_examples/example.cpp
   :linenos:
