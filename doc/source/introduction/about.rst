About
=====

The project is named 'Savu', after a python subspecies  known for their small size, good temperament, easy feeding habits and tolerance for a wide range of temperatures. `[1]`_

The Savu Tomography reconstruction pipeline project aims to mimic these behaviours being a small package, which is easy to use and reliable, chomps its way through vast amounts of data, and finally is portable to a wide range of systems. 

Be aware though, the following is also true "Savu Pythons are typically calm in disposition, and generally tolerate gentle handling. Like all snakes, however, care must be exercised when working around them." `[2]`_
